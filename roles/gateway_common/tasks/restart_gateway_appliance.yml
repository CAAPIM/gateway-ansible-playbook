# This set of tasks will restart a Gateway appliance, then monitor the shutdown/startup progress by
# checking that the Gateway cannot be reached via SSH (shutting down), that it can be reached via
# SSH (starting up), and finally that the Gateway is listening on the HTTP service request port (it
# is back up and ready to accept requests).
